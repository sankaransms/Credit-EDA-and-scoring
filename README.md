## **<font color=#00836c>Problem</font> statementðŸ‘€**

- To conduct a thorough **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deep analysis** of a comprehensive dataset containing basic customer details and extensive credit-related information.
- The aim is to **create new, informative features, calculate a hypothetical credit score, and uncover meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights** within the data.

## **Expectations**

The project expects a deep dive into bank details and credit data, creating valuable features, a hypothetical credit score, and uncovering hidden patterns. This involves thorough EDA, strategic feature engineering, model-driven score calculation, and insightful analysis that reveals factors influencing creditworthiness and guides potential risk mitigation strategies.

## **Concept UsedðŸ“‘**
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Credit Score Calculation
